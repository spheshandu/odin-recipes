    <p><em>For the tteok (rice cakes) and other ingredients:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups tteok (Korean rice cakes), soaked in warm water for about 20 minutes if they're hard</li>
        <li>1 cup cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup carrot, thinly sliced into matchsticks</li>
        <li>/2 cup onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup scallions (green onions), cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 cup fish cakes, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>1 hard-boiled egg per serving, halved (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the water, gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, honey (or corn syrup), minced garlic, minced ginger, sesame oil, and black pepper. Make sure the mixture is well combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil.
            Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage and carrots to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few minutes until they begin to soften.
            Add the soaked rice cakes (tteok) to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared tteokbokki sauce over the vegetables and rice cakes in the skillet. Stir everything together to coat the ingredients with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The rice cakes should soften and the sauce will thicken.</li>
        <li>f you're using fish cakes, add them to the skillet and stir them into the mixture. Let them cook for a few minutes until they're heated through.
            Add the scallions (green onions) to the skillet and stir them in. Reserve some scallions for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Once the rice cakes are soft and the vegetables are cooked to your liking, your tteokbokki is ready. It should have a thick and slightly spicy sauce.
            Serve the tteokbokki hot, garnished with additional sliced scallions and halved hard-boiled eggs if desired.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your homemade tteokbokki! Remember that the level of spiciness and sweetness can be adjusted according to your taste preferences.</p>
