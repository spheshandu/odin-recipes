    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar (optional for sweeter pancakes)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk (or 1 cup milk mixed with 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (or vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a griddle or non-stick frying pan on your stovetop and set it to medium-high heat. Allow it to heat while you prepare the pancake batter.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk (or milk and vinegar/lemon juice mixture), egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract (if using).</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spoon or whisk until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are okay.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the hot griddle or pan with a small amount of butter or oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Ladle about 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Use the back of the ladle to spread the batter into a circular shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes until you see small bubbles forming on the surface, and the edges start to look set, usually about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip each pancake with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the second side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the pancakes from the griddle or pan and place them on a plate. Keep them warm in a low oven (around 200°F or 93°C) if you're making a large batch.</li>
        <li>Serve your pancakes while they're still warm. Top with butter, syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or any other favorite toppings you prefer.</li>
        <li>Repeat the cooking process with the remaining batter until you've made all the pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy Your Pancakes!!!</p>
