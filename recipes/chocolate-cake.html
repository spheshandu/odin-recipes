   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>A chocolate cake is a scrumptious dessert that's all about the joy of chocolate. It's a moist and fluffy cake made with cocoa powder, flour, sugar, eggs, and a touch of oil or butter. The batter is baked until it transforms into a soft, dark brown cake with an irresistible aroma. Once cooled, it can be frosted with creamy chocolate icing or ganache, making it even more irresistible. Whether enjoyed on birthdays, celebrations, or simply as a sweet treat, chocolate cake is a timeless favorite that brings smiles to faces with its rich, chocolaty taste and tender texture.

   <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
   <p><em>For the cake:</em></p>
   <ul>
    <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
   </ul>
   <p><em>For the chocolate buttercream frosting:</em></p>
   <ul>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
   </ul>
   <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to combine.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until the batter is smooth.</li>
    <li>Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add the boiling water to the batter. Mix until well combined. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
    <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong>For The Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:</strong></p>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy and smooth.</li>
    <li>Sift in the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Mix on low speed until the sugar is incorporated.</li>
    <li>Add the milk and vanilla extract. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 3-4 minutes until the frosting is light and fluffy.
