   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>A chocolate cake is a scrumptious dessert that's all about the joy of chocolate. It's a moist and fluffy cake made with cocoa powder, flour, sugar, eggs, and a touch of oil or butter. The batter is baked until it transforms into a soft, dark brown cake with an irresistible aroma. Once cooled, it can be frosted with creamy chocolate icing or ganache, making it even more irresistible. Whether enjoyed on birthdays, celebrations, or simply as a sweet treat, chocolate cake is a timeless favorite that brings smiles to faces with its rich, chocolaty taste and tender texture.
